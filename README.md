# NgBootstrap

## Backend implementation

1. Based on [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with mocks from [faker](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js)

2. Run `npm run build` and `npm start` in order to launch the server (`http://localhost:3000`) with the distribution version of the app (APIs available at `http://localhost:3000/api/`)

3. The server randomly simulates delays and errors for testing purposes

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
